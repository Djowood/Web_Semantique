(Variety, which broke news of the casting, compared the project to \"Traffic,\" Steven Soderbergh\\'s ensemble movie about the war on drugs.) Here\\'s the plot description of \"The Big Short,\" via Amazon:The real story of the crash began in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn\\'t shine and the SEC doesn\\'t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower--and middle--class Americans who can\\'t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren\\'t talking. Pitt and Bale are never far from theaters -- both released movies within the last three months -- but the casting of Gosling is a welcome bit of news. The beloved star hasn\\'t appeared in a movie since 2013\\'s \"Only God Forgives.\" His next film, \"The Nice Guys,\" isn\\'t out until 2016. (The film Gosling directed, \"Lost River,\" opens in the spring.)For more on \"The Big Short,\" head to Variety.'"

We never realized that our happiness and openness would inspire so many individuals. The support we have received from our family, friends, and even strangers has led us to believe that our affection for each other is normal ...
